# i18next - Multiple Lang tool

## Introduction

i18next is an **internationalization-framework** written in and for JavaScript. But it's much more than that!

i18next goes beyond just providing the standard i18n features such as (plurals, context, interpolation, format). It provides you with a complete solution to localize your product from web to mobile and desktop.

Here we are going to hiligh its possibilities as a tool to handle multiple languages. It can be used with the most popular Javascript frameworks such as React, Vue and more...
As i am more familiar with React and it's the most popular JS front-end framework the rest of the solution will be presenteted using this stack. Also this setup might not be the most suitable for your project. I encourage you to check the [official documentation](https://www.i18next.com/) to match specific requirements and specifications.
You will be able to find the code and the ressources used at the end of the tutorial.

## Initialisation

We are gonna kickstart the project using Vite. if you already have a project created and only wish to add language support you can skip to [adding libs](###Installing-i18next-dependencies)

### Kickstarting of a project using Vite

Lets create a new project using React and Typescript with npm as a package manager. you could also use yarn or pnpm.

```bash
npm create vite@latest i18nextDemo -- --template react-ts
```

Let's make sure the project is running properly by running the website :

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

You should be able to see a generic project running :

### Installing i18next dependencies

Multiples interlinked libraries are gonna be used for this project. I will add them all at once with :

```bash
npm install i18next i18next-browser-languagedetector i18next-http-backend react-i18next
```

All done for the setup. Let's jump to the code !

## Boilerplate

Open up your favorite code editor and check the project structure. We are going to add support of 3 languages here : english , japanese and korean.

### Project structure

We are gonna create a few folders in the public directory to match the following file tree structure :

```
├── src/
│   ├── assets/
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── App.tsx
│   ├── main.tsx
│   └── ...
├── public/
│   ├── locales/
│   │   ├── en/
│   │   │   └── translation.json
│   │   ├── jp/
│   │   │   └── translation.json
│   │   └── ko/
│   │       └── translation.json
│   └── ...
├── index.html
├── package.json
├── tsconfig.json
└── ...

```

### Adding some code

Now we are going to add some code in `main.tsx` :

```typescript
import './index.css'
import App from './App'
import HttpApi from 'i18next-http-backend'
import LanguageDetector from 'i18next-browser-languagedetector'
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'
import i18n from 'i18next'
import { initReactI18next } from 'react-i18next'

i18n
  .use(initReactI18next) // passes i18n down to react-i18next
  .use(LanguageDetector)
  .use(HttpApi)
  .init({
    detection: {
      order: ['cookie', 'localStorage', 'htmlTag', 'path', 'subdomain'],
      caches: ['cookie']
    },
    fallbackLng: 'en',
    backend: {
      loadPath: '/locales/{{lng}}/translation.json'
    }
  })

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root') as HTMLElement).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
        <App /> {' '}
  </React.StrictMode>
)
```

And you are almost ready to go !

Here are some explanations concerning the important parts of the code :

```typescript
detection: {
      order: ["cookie", "localStorage", "htmlTag", "path", "subdomain"],
      caches: ["cookie"],
    },
    fallbackLng: "en",
    backend: {
      loadPath: "/locales/{{lng}}/translation.json",
    },
```

- The **order** parameter tells the application what is prioritary to determine the user language.
  _I.e : Here if it doesn't find the value in the cookie it will search for local storage and then htmlTag and so on_
- The **caches** parameter tells where to store the user preference. I recommend sticking with cookie or local storage as it is stored on the client device and can be easily persisted.
- **backend** tells where the translations should be located. If you followed a different structure then the one mentionned above you might have to configure this parameter differently.

### Values to translation files

Now that are project should be able to run, we need to add data to every translation file.

- `en`

```json
{
  "demo.hello.world": "Hello World"
}
```

- `jp`

```json
{
  "demo.hello.world": "こんにちは世界"
}
```

- `ko`

```json
{
  "demo.hello.world": "안녕하세요 세계"
}
```

## Using the values in the project.

Great our project is finnally completely setup. We can start to use our data in our application !

Let's jump to `App.tsx` and change the code a bit :

```typescript
[...]
import { useTranslation } from "react-i18next";

function App() {
  const { t } = useTranslation();
  return (
    <div className="App">
    [...]
      <p>
        <h1>{t("demo.hello.world")}</h1>
      </p>
    [...]
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## Demo

You can directly see the result in your project by running `npm run dev`
![demo-english](/Images/i18next/demo_english.png)

To see if it does work in the other provided languages, head to the inspector tool of you navigator (F12). Go to application tab and then cookie
![cookie](/Images/i18next/cookie.png)

You can modify the `en` variable with either `jp` or `ko`. Hit refresh and you should see some change on your page !

## Going further

You now have a fonctionning example of i18next for multiple language support. Here are a few ideas on how to continue this project :

- Add another language
- Add a button that lets you choose the desired language instead of changing it trough devTools.
